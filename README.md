# React Product Engineer

Product and user-focused React Engineer with personable and compassionate communication skills.

I have developed and maintained end-to-end products using Javascript and React. I am particularly interested in programming customer-centric SaaS applications, with a focus on data-driven decision making and rapid growth.

My understanding of user experience, and data analysis enables me to make informed product decisions. My colleagues have described me as detail-oriented, patient, and reliable.
